```

#### Getting Interview Questions
```
User: "Generate some physics questions for intermediate level"
Agent: "Here are some intermediate physics questions:
1. Can you explain Newton's second law and provide an example?
2. What is the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration?
3. How does energy conservation apply in mechanical systems?"
```

#### Performance Analysis
```
User: "How would you analyze my interview performance?"
Agent: "Based on your responses, you demonstrated strong conceptual understanding with clear explanations. Your technical accuracy was excellent, and you provided relevant examples. Areas for improvement include providing more detailed explanations for complex concepts."
```
