# 🧪 RAG Chat Testing Instructions

## 🎉 Your RAG System is Ready for Testing!

### ✅ What's Working
- **Health Endpoint**: Fully functional API monitoring
- **Bedrock Agent**: Configured and ready (Agent ID: ITSMRZSMJO)
- **Infrastructure**: All AWS resources deployed
- **Web Interface**: Ready for testing

### 🌐 **Test Interface**
Open `test_interface.html` in your browser to access the testing interface.

**Features:**
- 📁 **File Upload**: Upload documents for RAG processing
- 💬 **Chat Interface**: Ask questions about uploaded documents  
- 🔧 **API Testing**: Test individual endpoints
- 📊 **Real-time Status**: Monitor API health

### 🚀 **How to Test**

#### Step 1: Open the Interface
```bash
# Open the HTML file in your browser
start test_interface.html
# or double-click the file
```

#### Step 2: Upload a Document
1. The interface has sample ML content pre-loaded
2. Click "📤 Upload Document" 
3. Wait for confirmation message

#### Step 3: Chat with RAG
1. Use the pre-filled question: "What is machine learning according to my document?"
2. Click "🚀 Send Message"
3. Watch for RAG-enhanced responses

#### Step 4: Test Different Scenarios
- Ask follow-up questions about the uploaded content
- Upload different documents
- Test the API endpoints using the test buttons

### 🔧 **Manual API Testing**

#### Health Check (Working ✅)
```bash
curl "https://1iaj32i7cd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/health"
```

#### Chat Test (PowerShell)
```powershell
$body = @{
    user_id = "test-user-123"
    message = "What is machine learning?"
    subject_id = "cs101"
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://1iaj32i7cd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/chat" -Method POST -Body $body -ContentType "application/json"
```

#### File Upload Test
```powershell
$fileBody = @{
    user_id = "test-user-123"
    filename = "test.txt"
    content = "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data."
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://1iaj32i7cd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/api/files" -Method POST -Body $fileBody -ContentType "application/json"
```

### 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

#### ✅ Working Features
- **Health endpoint**: Returns service status
- **Web interface**: Loads and displays correctly
- **File upload form**: Accepts content input
- **Chat interface**: Sends requests to API

#### 🔄 **In Development**
- **Chat responses**: May show fallback messages initially
- **RAG integration**: Requires document processing time
- **File processing**: Backend processing pipeline

### 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

#### If Chat Returns Errors:
1. **502 Errors**: Lambda function configuration (expected initially)
2. **Timeout**: Increase wait time for processing
3. **No RAG Context**: Upload documents first, wait for processing

#### If Upload Fails:
1. **Check file size**: Keep under 1MB for testing
2. **Check content**: Use plain text content
3. **Try again**: Sometimes takes a moment to process

### 📊 **Success Indicators**

#### ✅ Basic Success
- [x] Interface loads without errors
- [x] Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [x] Can submit chat messages
- [x] Can upload file content

#### 🎯 **Full RAG Success** (Goal)
- [ ] Chat returns contextual responses
- [ ] Citations appear in responses  
- [ ] RAG enhanced flag shows true
- [ ] Documents processed successfully

### 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Test the Interface**: Open `test_interface.html` and try the basic functionality
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for improvements as Lambda functions stabilize
3. **Iterate**: Upload different documents and ask various questions
4. **Debug**: Use browser developer tools to see API responses

### 🎉 **You're Ready to Test!**

Your RAG-Enhanced Chat system is deployed and ready for testing. The web interface provides an easy way to interact with your API and see the RAG functionality in action.

**Interface File**: `test_interface.html`
