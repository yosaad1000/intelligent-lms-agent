# Hackathon Strategy: Simplified LMS Agent

## Problem Analysis
- Your current architecture is enterprise-grade but complex for hackathon timeline
- Friend's project is working but limited in scope
- Hackathon judges value: **working demo > complex architecture**

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Core Working Demo (Priority 1)
Build a simplified version that works immediately:

```
Student Upload → S3 → Bedrock Agent → Response
Voice Interview → Transcribe → Bedrock → Scoring
```

**Technology Stack:**
- FastAPI backend (like friend's approach)
- AWS Bedrock Agent (your advanced feature)
- Simple file upload to S3
- Basic voice interview functionality
- SQLite for demo data

### Phase 2: AWS Integration (Priority 2)
- Replace friend's direct Bedrock calls with Bedrock Agent
- Add Knowledge Base for uploaded notes
- Implement proper authentication

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority 3)
- Add intelligence embeddings
- Implement peer matching
- Group chat functionality

## Key Differences from Friend's Project

1. **Use Bedrock Agent** instead of direct LLM calls
2. **Knowledge Base integration** for uploaded notes
3. **Adaptive questioning** based on student performance
4. **Multi-subject support** with better context

## Implementation Timeline

**Day 1-2**: Core functionality working
**Day 3**: AWS integration and polish
**Day 4**: Advanced features and demo prep
**Day 5**: Testing and presentation

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Working file upload and Q&A
- ✅ Voice interview with scoring
- ✅ Bedrock Agent integration
- ✅ Clean demo presentation
- ✅ Deployed on AWS
