# Task 2: DynamoDB and Pinecone Setup - COMPLETED ✅

## 🎉 Task Status: COMPLETED
**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Success Rate:** 100% (7/7 tests passed)

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ **DynamoDB Tables Created**
All required tables for the LMS system:

#### Core Tables (Previously Existing)
- `lms-user-files` - File metadata and upload tracking
- `lms-chat-conversations` - Chat conversation management  
- `lms-chat-messages` - Individual chat messages
- `lms-file-metadata` - Additional file processing data

#### New Tables Added in Task 2
- `lms-quizzes` - Quiz definitions and configurations
- `lms-quiz-submissions` - Student quiz submissions and scores
- `lms-interviews` - Interview templates and configurations
- `lms-interview-sessions` - Individual interview sessions
- `lms-user-analytics` - User learning analytics and progress
- `lms-learning-progress` - Detailed concept mastery tracking

### ✅ **S3 Storage Configuration**
- Document storage bucket: `lms-documents-145023137830-1760886549`
- Proper folder structure for user files
- CORS configuration for web uploads
- Presigned URL generation for secure uploads

### ✅ **Pinecone Vector Database**
- Index: `lms-vectors` (1536 dimensions, cosine similarity)
- Successfully connected and tested
- Ready for RAG document storage and retrieval
- Vector operations (upsert, query, delete) all working

### ✅ **Lambda Utility Functions**
Created comprehensive utility libraries:

#### `src/shared/dynamodb_utils.py`
- **DynamoDBUtils class** - Complete CRUD operations
- **Helper functions** for creating records:
  - File records with metadata
  - Conversation and message records
  - Quiz and submission records
  - Analytics and progress records
- **JSON serialization** for DynamoDB Decimal types
- **Error handling** and logging

#### `src/shared/pinecone_utils.py`
- **PineconeUtils class** - Vector database operations
- **Document processing** utilities:
  - Text chunking with overlap
  - Metadata creation for vectors
  - RAG context formatting
- **Vector operations**:
  - Upsert, query, delete vectors
  - Index management and statistics
- **RAG helper functions** for document storage and retrieval

### ✅ **Integration Testing**
Comprehensive test suite (`test_data_storage_integration.py`):

1. **DynamoDB Connection** ✅ - All 9 tables accessible
2. **File Operations** ✅ - CRUD operations working
3. **Conversation Operations** ✅ - Chat data management
4. **Pinecone Connection** ✅ - Vector database accessible
5. **Vector Operations** ✅ - Upsert, query, delete working
6. **Document Chunking** ✅ - Text processing utilities
7. **Cross-Service Integration** ✅ - DynamoDB + Pinecone workflow

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure Ready For**

### Phase 2: AI Core Functionality
- **Task 3**: AWS Bedrock Agent SDK Integration
- **Task 4**: RAG File Processing Lambda Function  
- **Task 5**: RAG-Enhanced AI Chat Lambda Function

### Data Layer Capabilities
- ✅ **File Management**: Upload, metadata, processing status
- ✅ **Chat System**: Conversations, messages, context
- ✅ **Quiz System**: Creation, submission, scoring
- ✅ **Interview System**: Sessions, transcripts, analysis
- ✅ **Analytics**: User progress, concept mastery
- ✅ **Vector Storage**: Document embeddings, RAG retrieval

## 📊 **Database Schema Overview**

### File Management Flow
```
User Upload → lms-user-files → S3 Storage → Text Processing → Pinecone Vectors
```

### Chat System Flow  
```
User Message → lms-chat-conversations → lms-chat-messages → RAG Context → AI Response
```

### Quiz System Flow
```
Quiz Creation → lms-quizzes → Student Submission → lms-quiz-submissions → Analytics
```

### Analytics Flow
```
User Interactions → lms-user-analytics → lms-learning-progress → Personalization
```

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

**Ready to proceed with Task 3: AWS Bedrock Agent SDK Integration**

This will add:
- Multiple specialized AI agents (chat, quiz, interview, analysis)
- Bedrock Agent SDK integration in Lambda functions
- AI service wrappers with retry logic
- Agent invocation utilities

The data foundation is now complete and fully tested. All AI features can now be built on top of this solid infrastructure!
