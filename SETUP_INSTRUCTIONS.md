# üöÄ Repository Setup Instructions

## Quick Setup (Automated)

### Option 1: Using the Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Make the setup script executable
chmod +x setup_repo.sh

# Run the setup script
./setup_repo.sh
```

The script will:
- Initialize git repository
- Create GitHub repository (if you have GitHub CLI)
- Push all code to GitHub
- Provide next steps

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Step 1: Initialize Local Repository
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Intelligent LMS Agent project structure

- Complete microservices architecture with 5 services
- Authentication, File Processing, AI Chat, Voice Interview, Quiz Generator
- Comprehensive specifications and task lists
- Integration testing strategy
- Gradio-based user interface
- AWS Bedrock Agents integration
- Ready for hackathon development"
```

#### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `intelligent-lms-agent`
3. Description: `AI-powered Learning Management System with voice interviews and personalized quizzes. Built for AWS Hackathon with Bedrock Agents.`
4. Choose Public or Private
5. **Don't** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 3: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intelligent-lms-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## ü§ù Collaborative Setup

### For Your Friend (Team Member B)
Once the repository is created, your friend should:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intelligent-lms-agent.git
cd intelligent-lms-agent

# Set up development environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with AWS credentials
# (You'll need to share AWS credentials or set up separate accounts)
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branches for each microservice
git checkout -b feature/auth-service          # Team Member A
git checkout -b feature/file-processor        # Team Member B
git checkout -b feature/ai-chat               # Team Member A
git checkout -b feature/voice-interview       # Team Member A
git checkout -b feature/quiz-generator        # Team Member B

# Work on your assigned services
# Commit and push regularly
git add .
git commit -m "Implement authentication service basic functionality"
git push origin feature/auth-service

# Create pull requests for code review
# Merge to main when ready
```

## üéØ Next Steps After Repository Setup

### 1. AWS Environment Setup
Both team members need to set up AWS resources:

```bash
# Set up AWS credentials
aws configure

# Create required AWS resources:
# - Cognito User Pool
# - S3 Bucket
# - Bedrock Agent
# - DynamoDB Tables
```

### 2. Start Development
Follow the task lists in order:

**Team Member A (You):**
1. `.kiro/specs/auth-microservice/tasks.md`
2. `.kiro/specs/ai-chat-microservice/tasks.md` 
3. `.kiro/specs/voice-interview-microservice/tasks.md`

**Team Member B (Friend):**
1. `.kiro/specs/file-processor-microservice/tasks.md`
2. `.kiro/specs/quiz-generator-microservice/tasks.md`

### 3. Test the Application
```bash
# Run the main application
python main.py

# Open browser to http://localhost:7860
# You should see the Gradio interface with placeholder functionality
```

### 4. Development Timeline
- **Days 1-2**: Foundation services (Auth + File Processing)
- **Days 3-4**: Core AI features (Chat + Voice Interview)  
- **Days 5-6**: Advanced features (Quiz + Integration)
- **Day 7**: Demo preparation and final polish

## üìö Key Documentation

### For Development:
- `README.md` - Project overview and quick start
- `.kiro/specs/mvp-development-strategy.md` - Complete development strategy
- `.kiro/specs/integration-testing-strategy.md` - Testing approach
- Individual service specs in `.kiro/specs/[service-name]/`

### For Implementation:
- `src/shared/config.py` - Centralized configuration
- `src/shared/utils.py` - Shared utility functions
- `main.py` - Main Gradio application (currently with placeholders)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### Git Push Fails
```bash
# If you get authentication errors
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# If repository already exists
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/intelligent-lms-agent.git
```

#### Python Dependencies
```bash
# If pip install fails, try upgrading pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Or use virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### AWS Credentials
```bash
# Set up AWS credentials
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and region (us-east-1)

# Test AWS connection
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## üéâ Success Criteria

After setup, you should have:
- ‚úÖ GitHub repository created and code pushed
- ‚úÖ Both team members can clone and run the application
- ‚úÖ Gradio interface loads at http://localhost:7860
- ‚úÖ AWS credentials configured
- ‚úÖ Ready to start implementing microservices
