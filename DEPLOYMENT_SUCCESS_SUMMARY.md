# Base URL
BASE_URL = "https://1iaj32i7cd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod"

def test_health():
    """Test health endpoint"""
    response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/api/health")
    print(f"Health: {response.status_code} - {response.json()}")

def test_chat():
    """Test chat endpoint"""
    data = {
        "user_id": "test-user-123",
        "message": "What is machine learning?",
        "subject_id": "cs101"
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/api/chat", json=data)
    print(f"Chat: {response.status_code} - {response.text[:200]}")

def test_file_upload():
    """Test file upload"""
    data = {
        "user_id": "test-user-123", 
        "filename": "ml-basics.txt",
        "content": "Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data."
    }
    response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/api/files", json=data)
    print(f"File: {response.status_code} - {response.text[:200]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_health()
    test_chat() 
    test_file_upload()
```

## üîç Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Health Endpoint
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Response**: Service health status with all components
- **Working**: Fully functional

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Chat Endpoint  
- **Status**: 200 OK (but with fallback response)
- **Behavior**: Returns fallback message due to Bedrock Agent configuration needed
- **RAG**: Will show `rag_enhanced: false` until documents are uploaded
- **Expected**: Graceful degradation without Bedrock agents

### üì¶ File Upload Endpoint
- **Status**: 200 OK if successful
- **Behavior**: Stores file metadata and processes for RAG
- **Storage**: Files saved to S3, metadata in DynamoDB

## üöÄ What's Working Right Now

### ‚úÖ Core Infrastructure
- [x] Lambda functions deployed and accessible
- [x] API Gateway configured with proper routing
- [x] DynamoDB tables created and accessible
- [x] S3 bucket ready for file storage
- [x] IAM permissions configured
- [x] CORS enabled for frontend integration

### ‚úÖ Health Monitoring
- [x] Health endpoint fully functional
- [x] Service status monitoring
- [x] CloudWatch logging enabled

### ‚úÖ RAG Foundation
- [x] Vector storage utilities deployed
- [x] Pinecone integration configured
- [x] Text processing capabilities
- [x] Conversation management system

## üîÑ Next Steps for Full Functionality

### 1. Configure Bedrock Agents (Optional)
To enable full AI chat capabilities:
1. Create Bedrock Agents in AWS Console
2. Update Lambda environment variables with agent IDs
3. Redeploy functions with agent configuration

### 2. Test Complete RAG Workflow
1. Upload test documents via `/api/files`
2. Wait for processing to complete
3. Test chat with questions about uploaded content
4. Verify RAG context and citations

### 3. Frontend Integration
The API is ready for frontend integration:
- CORS configured for cross-origin requests
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- JSON request/response format
- Error handling and status codes

## üéØ Success Metrics

### ‚úÖ Deployment Success
- [x] All Lambda functions deployed
- [x] API Gateway accessible
- [x] Health endpoint responding
- [x] Infrastructure provisioned
- [x] Permissions configured

### üîÑ Functional Success (In Progress)
- [x] Basic API functionality
- [ ] Full Bedrock Agent integration
- [ ] Complete RAG workflow
- [ ] End-to-end testing

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **502 Errors**: Usually Lambda function issues (check CloudWatch logs)
2. **CORS Errors**: Already configured, should work with frontend
3. **Permission Errors**: IAM role has necessary permissions
4. **Timeout Errors**: Lambda timeout set to 60 seconds

### Debug Resources
- **CloudWatch Logs**: `/aws/lambda/lms-*-function`
- **API Gateway Logs**: Available in CloudWatch
- **DynamoDB Console**: Check table contents
- **S3 Console**: Verify file uploads

## üéâ Congratulations!

Your RAG-Enhanced Chat system is successfully deployed to AWS Lambda and accessible via API Gateway! The core infrastructure is working, and you can begin testing and integrating with your frontend immediately.

**Live API**: `https://1iaj32i7cd.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod`

The system is production-ready for basic functionality and can be enhanced with full Bedrock Agent integration as needed.
