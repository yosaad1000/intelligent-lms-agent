## Parallel Development Strategy

### File Processor (Current Developer)
- **Focus**: File upload, text extraction, Knowledge Base integration
- **Timeline**: Days 2-3 of development
- **Dependencies**: None (infrastructure ready)

### Voice Interview (Saksham)
- **Focus**: Audio processing, interview logic, voice UI
- **Timeline**: Days 2-4 of development  
- **Dependencies**: File processor for content access (can start independently)

### Integration Points
- **Shared Knowledge Base**: Both services will query processed documents
- **User Authentication**: Shared Cognito integration
- **Content Access**: Voice interview will access file processor's indexed content

## Getting Started - Saksham

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup (if not done)
git pull origin main
cd src/voice_interview

# Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies (already in requirements.txt)
pip install boto3 python-dotenv gradio
```

### 2. AWS Configuration
Your `.env` file is already configured with:
- AWS credentials
- S3 bucket access
- DynamoDB tables
- Cognito user pool

### 3. Start with Task 1: Audio Processing Setup
Check `.kiro/specs/voice-interview-microservice/tasks.md` for detailed breakdown.

### 4. Test Infrastructure Access
```bash
# Test AWS connectivity
python -c "import boto3; print('AWS access:', boto3.client('s3').list_buckets()['Buckets'][0]['Name'])"
```
