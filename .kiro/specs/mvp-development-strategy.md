## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing (Each Microservice)
```python
# Example test structure for each service
def test_auth_service():
    # Test registration, login, token validation
    pass

def test_file_processor():
    # Test file upload, text extraction, KB indexing
    pass

def test_ai_chat():
    # Test Bedrock Agent calls, response formatting
    pass

def test_quiz_generator():
    # Test quiz generation, scoring, feedback
    pass
```

### Integration Testing (Cross-Service)
```python
def test_complete_user_flow():
    # 1. Register user
    # 2. Login
    # 3. Upload file
    # 4. Ask question about file
    # 5. Generate quiz from file
    # 6. Take quiz and get score
    pass
```

### Manual Testing Checkpoints
- **Daily**: Test your assigned microservice via Gradio interface
- **Day 2**: Cross-service integration test
- **Day 4**: End-to-end user journey test
- **Day 5**: Demo rehearsal and edge case testing

## Merge Strategy

### Option 1: Single Gradio App (Recommended for MVP)
```python
# main_app.py - Combined application
import gradio as gr
from auth_service import FastAuth
from file_processor import FastFileProcessor  
from ai_chat import FastAIChat
from quiz_generator import FastQuizGenerator

def create_integrated_app():
    auth = FastAuth()
    file_proc = FastFileProcessor()
    ai_chat = FastAIChat()
    quiz_gen = FastQuizGenerator()
    
    with gr.Blocks() as app:
        gr.Markdown("# üéì Intelligent LMS Agent")
        
        with gr.Tabs():
            with gr.Tab("üîê Login"):
                # Auth interface
                pass
            with gr.Tab("üìÅ Upload Notes"):
                # File processor interface
                pass
            with gr.Tab("üí¨ Chat with AI"):
                # AI chat interface
                pass
            with gr.Tab("üìù Take Quiz"):
                # Quiz generator interface
                pass
    
    return app
```

### Option 2: Microservices with API Gateway (If Needed Later)
```bash
# If you need to scale beyond MVP
/auth-service/     ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda
/file-service/     ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda  
/chat-service/     ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda
/quiz-service/     ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks & Solutions
1. **Bedrock Agent Setup Complexity**
   - **Risk**: Agent configuration takes too long
   - **Solution**: Start with direct Bedrock Runtime calls, upgrade to Agent later

2. **Knowledge Base Indexing Delays**
   - **Risk**: KB takes time to index uploaded content
   - **Solution**: Implement simple text search as fallback

3. **Gradio Integration Issues**
   - **Risk**: Services don't integrate smoothly in Gradio
   - **Solution**: Test integration daily, keep interfaces simple

### Timeline Risks & Solutions
1. **Feature Creep**
   - **Risk**: Adding too many features
   - **Solution**: Stick to MVP scope, document future features

2. **Integration Delays**
   - **Risk**: Services don't work together
   - **Solution**: Daily integration tests, simple interfaces
