# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables rapid testing of AWS Bedrock Agent functionality in a local React frontend environment without requiring complex authentication setup or backend deployment. The solution provides a hybrid approach using mock authentication with direct AWS Bedrock Agent integration.

## Glossary

- **Hybrid Testing Mode**: A development configuration that uses mock authentication locally while connecting directly to real AWS Bedrock Agent services
- **Direct Agent Service**: A simplified service layer that bypasses complex authentication flows and directly calls AWS Bedrock Agent APIs
- **Mock Auth**: Local authentication simulation that provides user context without requiring Supabase or external authentication services
- **Agent Testing Interface**: UI components specifically designed for testing and validating Bedrock Agent functionality

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test AWS Bedrock Agent functionality locally without setting up complex authentication, so that I can validate AI features quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer configures hybrid testing mode, THE System SHALL use mock authentication for user management
2. WHEN the developer makes AI requests, THE System SHALL connect directly to the deployed AWS Bedrock Agent
3. WHEN authentication is needed for UI components, THE System SHALL provide mock user data
4. WHERE AWS credentials are configured, THE System SHALL authenticate directly with AWS services
5. THE System SHALL maintain all existing UI functionality while enabling real AI testing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test AI chat functionality with the real Bedrock Agent, so that I can validate conversation flows and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a chat message, THE Direct_Agent_Service SHALL invoke the Bedrock Agent with the message
2. WHEN the Bedrock Agent responds, THE System SHALL display the response in the chat interface
3. WHEN multiple messages are sent, THE System SHALL maintain conversation context through session management
4. IF the agent call fails, THEN THE System SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. THE System SHALL log all agent interactions for debugging purposes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test document analysis with the real Bedrock Agent, so that I can validate document processing and AI insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded, THE System SHALL process it through the real document processing pipeline
2. WHEN document analysis is requested, THE Direct_Agent_Service SHALL send the document context to the Bedrock Agent
3. WHEN the agent provides insights, THE System SHALL display them in the document manager interface
4. WHERE document processing fails, THE System SHALL provide clear error feedback
5. THE System SHALL support PDF document upload and analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test quiz generation with the real Bedrock Agent, so that I can validate AI-powered assessment creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN quiz generation is requested, THE Direct_Agent_Service SHALL send content context to the Bedrock Agent
2. WHEN the agent generates quiz questions, THE System SHALL format and display them appropriately
3. WHEN quiz parameters are specified, THE System SHALL pass them to the agent for customized generation
4. IF quiz generation fails, THEN THE System SHALL provide fallback options or error messages
5. THE System SHALL support multiple quiz formats and difficulty levels

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test interview practice with the real Bedrock Agent, so that I can validate AI-powered interview simulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interview practice is started, THE Direct_Agent_Service SHALL initialize an interview session with the Bedrock Agent
2. WHEN the user provides responses, THE System SHALL send them to the agent for evaluation
3. WHEN the agent provides feedback, THE System SHALL display it in an appropriate format
4. WHERE voice input is used, THE System SHALL process it before sending to the agent
5. THE System SHALL maintain interview context throughout the session

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal setup time for agent testing, so that I can focus on validating functionality rather than configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs the setup, THE System SHALL require only AWS CLI configuration
2. WHEN environment variables are set, THE System SHALL automatically detect hybrid testing mode
3. WHEN the application starts, THE System SHALL provide clear indicators of the current testing mode
4. WHERE setup issues occur, THE System SHALL provide helpful diagnostic information
5. THE System SHALL complete setup in under 20 minutes from start to testing
