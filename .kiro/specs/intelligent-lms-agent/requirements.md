# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent LMS AI Agent is a comprehensive learning management system that leverages AWS AI services to provide personalized education experiences. The system enables students to upload learning materials, interact with AI tutors, take adaptive assessments, and receive personalized recommendations. Teachers gain insights through analytics dashboards and AI-generated feedback. The agent demonstrates autonomous capabilities through note analysis, voice interview processing, adaptive testing, and intelligent content recommendations, making it suitable for the AWS Agentic Hackathon requirements.
