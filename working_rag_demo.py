    Machine Learning Fundamentals
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.
    
    Types of Machine Learning:
    
    Supervised Learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping function from input variables to output variables. Examples include classification and regression problems.
    
    Unsupervised Learning finds hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    
    Reinforcement Learning involves an agent that learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment to maximize cumulative reward.
    
    Key Concepts:
    Training Data is the dataset used to teach the machine learning algorithm. Features are individual measurable properties of observed phenomena. A Model is the mathematical representation of a real-world process. An Algorithm is the method used to build the model.
    
    Applications:
    Machine learning is used in various fields including image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and financial fraud detection.
