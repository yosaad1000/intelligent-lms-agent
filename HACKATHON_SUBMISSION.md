## 🎬 **Demo Video Script (3 Minutes)**

### 🎯 **Minute 1: System Overview & Document Processing**
```
"Welcome to our Intelligent LMS Agent - a production-ready AI system built on AWS Bedrock AgentCore.

[Screen: Architecture diagram]
Our hybrid architecture combines Bedrock's managed infrastructure with LangGraph's workflow flexibility.

[Screen: Document upload]
Let me upload a physics textbook PDF. Watch as our system uses AWS Textract for extraction and Comprehend for analysis, then automatically indexes it in our Knowledge Base with Pinecone vector storage - saving 80% compared to OpenSearch Serverless."
```

### 🎯 **Minute 2: Multi-Modal AI Capabilities**
```
[Screen: Chat interface]
"Now I'll ask: 'Summarize the quantum mechanics chapter.' Notice how our LangGraph workflow detects the intent, routes to document processing, and provides a comprehensive summary with citations.

[Screen: Voice interface]
Next, our star feature - voice interviews. I'll ask a physics question verbally. Our system uses AWS Transcribe for real-time speech-to-text, analyzes my pronunciation and fluency, then generates adaptive follow-up questions based on my response quality."
```

### 🎯 **Minute 3: Learning Analytics & Production Readiness**
```
[Screen: Analytics dashboard]
"The system tracks learning progress in real-time, calculating concept mastery and providing personalized recommendations.

[Screen: AWS Console]
This isn't just a demo - it's production-ready. Here's our Bedrock Agent deployed with a production alias, complete with monitoring, security, and auto-scaling.

[Screen: Cost comparison]
Our architecture delivers enterprise features at 80% lower cost through strategic design choices. This is the future of AI-powered education."
